# Tasks

These are the tasks for the first lab.

## Task 1

```{r, include=TRUE}
setwd("C:/Users/golfe/Desktop/Applied Statistical Methods/LAB1")
getwd()
list.files()
```
## Task 2

Reading in the data into ddt.
```{r}
ddt <- read.csv("Dataxls/Dataxls/DDT.csv")
head(ddt)
```

## Task 3
- Using class() function, we can conclude that SPECIES and RIVER classes are quantitative data, since they have character values.
```{r}
class(ddt$SPECIES)
class(ddt$RIVER)
```
- Likewise, we can conclude the quantitative variables of the data frame are: MILE, LENGTH, and WEIGHT
```{r}
class(ddt$MILE)
class(ddt$LENGTH)
class(ddt$WEIGHT)
```
Next, finding observations with SPECIES, LMBASS and WEIGHT bigger than 800gms. We set species equal to "LMBASS" and WEIGHT>800.
```{r}
with(ddt, ddt[WEIGHT>800 & SPECIES=="LMBASS",])
```

Next, finding observations where the RIVER is SCM and DDT bigger than 4.0. We set RIVER equal to "SCM" and DDT>4.0.
```{r}
#FIXME
with(ddt, ddt[RIVER=="SCM" & DDT>4.0,])
```

## Task 4
The mean of length of fish:
```{r}
mean(ddt$LENGTH)
```
Finding the standard deviation of weight.
```{r}
sd(ddt$WEIGHT)
```
Verifying length vs weight
```{r}
plot(ddt$LENGTH, ddt$WEIGHT, ylab="LENGTH", xlab="WEIGHT")
1
```
